# Generates PDF from HTML with custom headers and footers with wkhtmltopdf v1.2.202-179  

This is an open-source project. Star this repository if you like it, or even donate!  Thank you so much! :)

I run my own server with dynamic IP address so it may happen that the server can not be reachable for about max 5 minutes due to the dynamic DNS. The server may also be unreachable when I backup the SSD with Clonzilla (very rarely) or an electrical issue (but this should not happen again). When the server is down, please hang on for 5-30 minutes and the server will be back up.

All my domains (patrikx3.com and corifeus.com) could have errors since I am developing in my free time. However, it is usually stable.

Generates PDF from HTML with custom headers and footers with wkhtmltopdf

# First version
Since, the basic installation, we need scripts to startup the library:
```bash
yarn install p3x-html-pdf
```

Soon, it will work with OSX as well.

It is a ```microservice``` that I created for my job with Sygnus.

Given of the amount of code I write, sometimes it takes to write documentation.
